While it is possible to convert a Spring Boot uber jar into a Docker image with just a few lines in the Dockerfile, using the xref:packaging/container-images/efficient-images.adoc#packaging.container-images.efficient-images.layering[layering feature] will result in an optimized image.
When you create a jar containing the layers index file, the `spring-boot-jarmode-tools` jar will be added as a dependency to your jar.
With this jar on the classpath, you can launch your application in a special mode which allows the bootstrap code to run something entirely different from your application, for example, something that extracts the layers.

CAUTION: The `tools` mode can not be used with a xref:how-to:deployment/installing.adoc[fully executable Spring Boot archive] that includes a launch script.
Disable launch script configuration when building a jar file that is intended to be used with `layertools`.

Hereâ€™s how you can launch your jar with a `tools` jar mode:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -Djarmode=tools -jar my-app.jar
----

This will provide the following output:

[subs="verbatim"]
----
Usage:
  java -Djarmode=tools -jar my-app.jar

Available commands:
  extract      Extract the contents from the jar
  list-layers  List layers from the jar that can be extracted
  help         Help about any command
----

The `extract` command can be used to easily split the application into layers to be added to the Dockerfile.
Here is an example of a Dockerfile using `jarmode`.

[source,dockerfile]
----
# Perform the extraction in a separate builder container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:17-cds AS builder
WORKDIR /builder
# This points to the built jar file in the target folder
# Adjust this to 'build/libs/*.jar' if you're using Gradle
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
# Copy the jar file to the working directory and rename it to application.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} application.jar
# Extract the jar file using an efficient layout
RUN java -Djarmode=tools -jar application.jar extract --layers --destination extracted

# This is the runtime container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:17-cds
WORKDIR /application
# Copy the extracted jar contents from the builder container into the working directory in the runtime container
# Every copy step creates a new docker layer
# This allows docker to only pull the changes it really needs
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/application/ ./
# Start the application jar - this is not the uber jar used by the builder
# This jar only contains application code and references to the extracted jar files
# This layout is efficient to start up and CDS friendly
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
----

Assuming the above `Dockerfile` is in the current directory, your Docker image can be built with `docker build .`, or optionally specifying the path to your application jar, as shown in the following example:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=path/to/myapp.jar .
----

This is a multi-stage Dockerfile.
The builder stage extracts the directories that are needed later.
Each of the `COPY` commands relates to the layers extracted by the jarmode.

Of course, a Dockerfile can be written without using the `jarmode`.
You can use some combination of `unzip` and `mv` to move things to the right layer but `jarmode` simplifies that.
Additionally, the layout created by the `jarmode` is CDS friendly out of the box.
